This simple tool allows you to download high-resolution images from the [Warner Bros. Discovery press site](https://press.wbd.com/) without the need for an account. While normally you might only access downscaled versions (typically 1920x1080 pixels), WBD-Downloader enables you to download images up to 3000x2000 pixels.
